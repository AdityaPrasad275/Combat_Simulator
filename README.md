# Combat_Simulator
A very rudimentary combat simulator based on 3 variables, health, damage, chance (dice roll) . 

Has 2 teams , humans and skeletons (which have a bit "different" names in the code) , stored in vectors so the size of teams is variable . 

the stats such as health and damage can be changed in the declaration of thier structs and it is quite interesting how the results depend on them

fare warning of rough but non intentional language usage .
